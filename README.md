Made with Python and Tkiner GUI.

This program calculates the equivalent grade of various metals such as Copper and Zinc. It also calculates the weighted average of Copper, Zinc, Gold, and Silver over a segment of a drill hole. This was intended for use in Geophysics related fields, as it allows one to calculate important figures with ease while writing reports of drill sites.
